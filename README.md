[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://ligue-1-predictor.streamlit.app/)

## Project Description
This repository contains a professional-grade statistical forecasting engine for the French Ligue 1. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning* principles to sports data to provide actionable match insights.

##  Methodology: Logistic Regression
The predictive engine utilizes a **Logistic Regression** model from the `scikit-learn` library. 
* *Classification.* Unlike linear models, this approach is optimized for categorical outcomes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win).
* *Probabilistic Output.* The model uses the `predict_proba` function to generate a nuanced probability distribution, allowing for a better assessment of match volatility.
* *Feature Set.* Data includes goals scored/conceded, team strength index, and historical performance normalized for the 18-club 2025-2026 format.
